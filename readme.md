Ths repository contains a collection of neural operator architectures as well as base blocks.  
This is currently a work in progress.

Implemented models:
- DeepONet
- Fourier Neural Operator (with or without Tucker factorization): FNO and U-FNO blocks
- Learned Integral Tranforms Network with difernt base blocks:
    - Linear separable and non separable
    - Non-Linear separable and non-separable
    - Complex Self-Attention in transformed space

Other popular blocks are also available (Residual, Bottleneck, COnvNext, etc.)
